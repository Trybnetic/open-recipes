Open Recipes is a simple jekyll theme to organize and host your favorite recipes.  

## How to use
To use Open Recipes you have to install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). After successfully installing jekyll you have to clone this repository to your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/Trybnetic/open-recipes.git
```
Then switch into the directory and start jekyll:
```
cd open-recipes
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
The last command starts a webserver on your local machine. Now you should have a copy of the site running at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/open-recipes/`. Open this url with your webbrowser and explore the site.  
By changing some of the files (except of the `config.yml`) the changes will be displayed immediately. If you want to add or change recipes you have to go to the `_posts` folder. Here are the markdown files for all recipes.  
If you want to create a new recipe the easiest way is to copy an existing one and change it to your favor. If you want to show an image for your recipe put it to `assets/images/`.
